### Prerequisites

Before starting you need some background on JavaScript basics. Check the links bellow.

Besides, it is necesary to use an HTTP Server to access the index.html page of the project.

The easiest way to install an HTTP Server is with the node package http-server. But first you have to install node.js from https://nodejs.org/es/download/. It's advisable to install the LTS version.

After that you can install the http-server package:

```
npm install -g http-server
```

### Installing the project once the previous prerequisites are satisfied.

Open a command line console and clone this project.

```
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/SVGVanillaJSMouseOverAndOut
```

Go to the new created directory

```
cd SVGVanillaJSMouseOverAndOut
```

Start your http-server

```
http-server
```

In a browser window open the URL http://localhost:8080, and you'll get the result you see above in the animated gif.

Enjoy!!!
